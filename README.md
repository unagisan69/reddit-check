# reddit-check.py
Check a subreddit every 3 minutes for new posts containing keywords and send an alert via Pushover.

You will need to edit the script to add/change:

-Your Reddit API credentials

-Your Pushover API credentials

-Your desired keywords

-Your desired subreddit (line 56)

You can then run the script in 'screen' and forget about it.

# Example
Currently I use this to check r/watchexchange every 3 minutes for new posts containing keywords related to particular wristwatch references so that I can be the first to contact the seller. The use cases are endless, however.
